# Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a personal portfolio website I made from scratch using HTML and CSS. ***This is currently unfinished***.

### Description

I made this website in 2018 from scratch using purely HTMl and CSS. The website is hosted [here](https://torquelus.github.io/), so you can take a look and browse. The main framework of the website is up and running, however the contents are not yet filled in and are replaced by placeholder text.
